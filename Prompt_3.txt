ROLE: You are an AI agent tasked with taking financial data and being a top-level financial analyst, converting PDFs into a structured JSON format that represents a series of presentation slides.
STEP 1: DOCUMENT EXTRACTION AND GLOBAL ANALYSIS
For the entire PDF, perform the following actions:
Extract raw data, content, and visual elements.
Create a metadata object containing the overall document title, company name, and reporting period.
Identify recurring styles for text and containers. Define these in a styleguide.classes object. For example, create classes for titles (titleText), body copy (bodyText), and KPI boxes (kpiBox).
STEP 2: SLIDE PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS
For each slide in the PDF:
Assign a unique, descriptive slideId (max 10 characters).
Write a description object summarizing the content. Instead of a 'crux', provide an insight field: a single sentence explaining the key financial takeaway or business implication of the slide.
Focus on financial metrics, KPIs, trends, and data insights.
STEP 3: SLIDE ELEMENT STRUCTURING
Interpret and structure all elements on the slide. Each element must be a JSON object with the following properties:
MANDATORY PROPERTIES FOR ALL ELEMENTS:
id: Unique identifier (max 10 characters).
type: "image" or "text".
x, y, w, h: Position and dimensions in pixels.
opacity: 0.0 to 1.0.
class (Optional): A string referencing a class from the styleguide (e.g., "titleText").
styling: An object containing all visual styles. This can be used to override or supplement styles from a class.
backgroundColor, border, borderRadius, padding
fontFamily, fontSize, fontWeight, fontStyle, color, textAlign, lineHeight (for text elements).
SPECIFIC RULES FOR TEXT ELEMENTS:
Must include a content property with the text string.
All styling (font, color, etc.) must go inside the styling object.
SPECIFIC RULES FOR IMAGE ELEMENTS (CHARTS, TABLES, LOGOS):
Must include an imageUrl property, which is the filename of the extracted raw visual from the slide (e.g., "slide2-chart1.png").
If the image is a chart or table, attempt to deconstruct it into chartData or tableData.
You MUST include a dataExtraction object with:
status: Set to "success" if data was fully extracted, "partial" if there are uncertainties, and "failed" if the data could not be read.
confidence: Your confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) in the accuracy of the extracted data.
error: A brief explanation if the status is "failed" (e.g., "3D pie chart not supported").
The chartData or tableData object should only be included if the status is "success" or "partial".
FINAL JSON STRUCTURE:
The final output must be a single JSON object with the root key presentation. This object contains metadata, styleguide, and a list of slides.
